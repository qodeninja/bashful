# Bashful

 Every good environment does fine

## Setup

Easy peasy

To get started we'll configure the environment to run the bashful scripts.

To do this, go into the project directory and run

  ```
    > source setup

  ```

With the environment prepped you can now run any of the utilities:

  ```
    > bashful install
    > bashful uninstall
    > bashful clean
    > bashful help
  ```
